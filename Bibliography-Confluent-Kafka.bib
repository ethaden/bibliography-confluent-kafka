  abstract  = {Distributed messaging systems form the core of big data streaming, cloud native applications and microservice architecture. With real-time critical applications there is a growing need for well-built messaging platform that is scalable, fault tolerant and has low latency. There are multiple modern messaging systems that have come up in the recent past, all with their own pros and cons. This has become problematic for the industry to decide which messaging system is the most suitable for a specific application. An in-depth study is required to decide which features of a messaging system meet the needs of the application. This survey paper outlines the modern messaging technologies and delves deep on three popular publisher/subscriber systems- Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ and NATS Streaming. The paper provides information about messaging systems, the use cases, similarities and differences of features to facilitate users to make an informed decision and also pave way for future research and development.},

  abstract  = {IoT (Internet of Things) is a concept that broadens the idea of connecting multiple devices to each other over the Internet and enabling communication between these devices. Traditionally, the packets are sent over the network for communication only if both, the sender as well as the receiver, are online. This forces the sender and the receiver to be online 24×7; which is not achievable in each and every environment the devices communicates in. Considering the humongous data generated in the communication, it is necessary to store and process this data so that data insights can be identified to improve the organizational benefits. This generated data can be in two forms, real-time as well as existing or historical data. When this data is obtained in real-time and it is processed, even traditional big data technologies do not perform up to the mark. Hence to process this real-time data, streaming of this data is required; which is not a feature of traditional big data technologies. To achieve these objectives, the proposed architecture uses open source technologies such as Apache Kafka, for online and offline consumption of messages, and Apache Spark, to stream, process and provide a structure to the real-time and existing data. A framework known as Dashing is used to present the processed data in a more attractive and readable manner.},

  abstract  = {The rise of streaming data processing is driven by mass deployment of sensors, the increasing popularity of mobile devices, and the rapid growth of online financial trading. Apache Kafka is often used as a real-time messaging system for many stream processors. However, efficiently running Kafka as a reliable data source is challenging, especially in the case of real-time processing with unstable network connection. We find that changing configuration parameters can significantly impact the guarantee of message delivery in Kafka. Therefore the key to solving the above problem is to predict the reliability of Kafka given various configurations and network conditions. We define two reliability metrics to be predicted, the probability of message loss and the probability of message duplication. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are applied in our prediction model and we select some key parameters, as well as network metrics as the features. To collect sufficient training data for our model we build a Kafka testbed based on Docker containers. With the neural network model we can predict Kafka's reliability for different application scenarios given various network environments. Combining with other metrics that a streaming application user may care for, a weighted key performance indicator (KPI) of Kafka is proposed for selecting proper configuration parameters. In the experiments we propose a rough dynamic configuration scheme, which significantly improves the reliability while guaranteeing message timeliness.},

Common application scenarios include market feed processing and electronic trading, maintenance of IoT devices and fraud detection. In some scenarios reliability is the utmost concern while in others speed and simplicity are the top priority. Apache Kafka is a high-throughput distributed messaging system and its reliable stream delivery capability makes it an ideal source of data for stream-processing systems. With various configurable parameters Kafka is very flexible in reliable data delivery thus allowing all kinds of reliability tradeoffs. In this paper we introduce a tool for Testing the Reliability of Apache Kafka (TRAK), to study different data delivery semantics in Kafka and compare their reliability under poor network quality. We build a Kafka testbed using Docker containers and use a network emulation tool to control the network delay and loss. Two metrics, message loss rate and duplicate rate, are used in our experiments to evaluate the reliability of data delivery in Kafka. The experimental results show that under high network delay the size of messages matters. The at-least-once semantics is more reliable than at-most-once in a network with high packet loss, but can lead to duplicated messages.},

The more network traffic has enhanced, the more cyberattacks have dramatically increased. Therefore, cybersecurity intrusion detection has been a challenge in the current research area in recent years. The Intrusion detection system requires high-level protection and detects modern and complex attacks with more accuracy. Nowadays, big data analytics is the main key to solve marketing, security and privacy in an extremely competitive financial market and government. If a huge amount of stream data flows within a short period time, it is difficult to analyze real-time decision making. Performance analysis is extremely important for administrators and developers to avoid bottlenecks. The paper aims to reduce time-consuming by using Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming. Experiments on the UNSWNB-15 dataset indicate that the integration of Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming can perform better in terms of processing time and fault-tolerance on the huge amount of data. According to the results, the fault tolerance can be provided by the multiple brokers of Kafka and parallel recovery of Spark Streaming. And then, the multiple partitions of Apache Kafka increase the processing time in the integration of Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming.},

  abstract  = {Modern stream processing systems need to process large volumes of data in real-time. Various stream processing frameworks have been developed and messaging systems are widely applied to transfer streaming data among different applications. As a distributed messaging system with growing popularity, Apache Kafka processes streaming data in small batches for efficiency. However, the robustness of Kafka's batching method against variable operating conditions is not known. In this paper we study the impact of the batch size on the performance of Kafka. Both configuration parameters, the spatial and temporal batch size, are considered. We build a Kafka testbed using Docker containers to analyze the distribution of Kafka's end-to-end latency. The experimental results indicate that evaluating the mean latency only is unreliable in the context of real-time systems. In the experiments where network faults are injected, we find that the batch size affects the message loss rate in the presence of an unstable network connection. However, allocating resources for message processing and delivery that will violate the reliability requirements implemented as latency constraints of a real-time system is inefficient To address these challenges we propose a reactive batching strategy. We evaluate our batching strategy in both good and poor network conditions. The results show that the strategy is powerful enough to meet both latency and throughput constraints even when network conditions are variable.},

Their ability to scale horizontally enables users to adapt to growing data volumes and changing environments. However, one of the main challenges concerning message brokers is the danger of them becoming a bottleneck within an IT architecture. To prevent this, knowledge about the amount of data a message broker using a specific configuration can handle needs to be available. In this paper, we propose a monitoring architecture for message brokers and similar Java Virtual Machine-based systems. We present a comprehensive performance analysis of the popular Apache Kafka platform using our approach. As part of the benchmark, we study selected data ingestion scenarios with respect to their maximum data ingestion rates. The results show that we can achieve an ingestion rate of about 420,000 messages/second on the used commodity hardware and with the developed data sender tool.},

However, services that involve moving image analysis require large amounts of data to be transferred continuously and high computing power for the analysis; hence, it is difficult to process them in real time in the cloud using a conventional stream data processing framework. First, we perform preliminary experiments using Apache Spark [3] (hereinafter called Spark), which is a representative cluster computing platform that is designed to be fast and versatile, and Ray [4] , which is a distributed execution framework.

Apache Kafka is a representative distributed messaging system, specialized in delivering large amounts of real-time log data. However, if the production rate of data in Kafka is faster than the consumption rate, data starvation problem may arise. In order to solve the starvation problem, a load shedding technique is needed to limit the incoming data and maintain system performance when the system is under load. Thus, in this paper confirmed the starvation problem that can occur in Kafka, and we designed and implemented a load shedding engine to solve this problem and proposed a solution to the starvation problem in Kafka based on the performance experiment.},

Therefore, it’s necessary to develop new IDS able to detect attacks with high performance. In this paper, we present a distributed IDS based on big data tools and machine learing algorithms to detect attacks in the cloud systems. This proposed system designed to be installed in the front of cloud network architecture. The network traffic is collected from edge routers and streamed with Kafka component to Spark component for prepressing, anomaly detection and attack classification. In preprocessing stage, data cleaning, formatting and feature selection based on K-means clustering are performed. In the anomaly detection and attack classification, we compared different machine learning algorithms optimized with hypermeters tuning based on grid search. Various experiments are conducted on Google cloud platform to evaluated the system using CIDDS-001 dataset. The Decision tree classifier outperform all in term of accuracy and F1-score in anomaly detection stage the same for attacks classification stage, Random Forest yielded Decision tree in term of accuracy and F1-score.

It uses partitions to scale a topic across many brokers for producers to write data in parallel, and also to facilitate parallel reading of consumers. Even though Apache Kafka provides some out of the box optimizations, it does not strictly define how each topic shall be efficiently distributed into partitions. The well-formulated fine-tuning that is needed in order to improve an Apache Kafka cluster performance is still an open research problem. In this paper, we first model the Apache Kafka topic partitioning process for a given topic. Then, given the set of brokers, constraints and application requirements on throughput, OS load, replication latency and unavailability, we formulate the optimization problem of finding how many partitions are needed and show that it is computationally intractable, being an integer program. Furthermore, we propose two simple, yet efficient heuristics to solve the problem: the first tries to minimize and the second to maximize the number of brokers used in the cluster. Finally, we evaluate its performance via largescale simulations, considering as benchmarks some Apache Kafka cluster configuration recommendations provided by Microsoft and Confluent. We demonstrate that, unlike the recommendations, the proposed heuristics respect the hard constraints on replication latency and perform better w.r.t. unavailability time and OS load, using the system resources in a more prudent way.},

The stakeholders that deliver pervasive applications are now able to address fundamental challenges in the big data value chain, from data acquisition, data analysis and processing, data storage and curation, and data visualisation in real scenarios. Industry 4.0 is pushing this trend forward, demanding for servitization of products and data, also for the smart cities sector where humans, sensors and devices are operating in strict collaboration. The data produced by the ubiquitous devices must be processed quickly to allow the implementation of reactive services such as situational awareness, video surveillance and geo-localization, while always ensuring the safety and privacy of involved citizens. This paper proposes a modular architecture to (i) leverage innovative technologies for data acquisition, management and distribution (such as Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi), (ii) develop a multi-layer engineering solution for revealing valuable and hidden societal knowledge in smart cities environment, and (iii) tackle the main issues in tasks involving complex data flows and provide general guidelines to solve them. We derived some guidelines from an experimental setting performed together with leading industrial technical departments to accomplish an efficient system for monitoring and servitization of smart city assets, with a scalable platform that confirms its usefulness in numerous smart city use cases with different needs.},

REMUS is now making use of modern data streaming technologies in order to provide a secure, reliable, scalable and loosely coupled solution for streaming near real-time data in and out of the system. Integrating the open-source streaming platform Apache Kafka allows the system to stream near real-time data to Data Visualization Tools and Web Interfaces. It also permits full-duplex communication with external Control Systems and IIoT - Industrial Internet Of Things - devices, without compromising the security of the system and using a widely adopted technology. This paper describes the architecture of the system put in place, and the numerous applications it opens up for REMUS and Control Systems in general.},

Existing works tend to train cognitive models on data and derive insights from it. The insights may or may not be in real-time. This proposed work illustrates a real-time streaming analytics framework to predict congestions on multivariate IoT data streams in a smart city scenario. With an increase in the connected devices and Machine to Machine (M2M) communications, there is also a rise in the volumes of data generated. To handle such voluminous data, the frameworks needs to address scalability and reliability aspects. In this research, we present an architecture with the help of open source components that simulate an IoT streaming scenario in a persistent way and a batch analytics engine that processes the data inputs in order to produce higher order, granular insights. For the proposed work, we have used unsupervised learning approaches to identify congestions in traffic scenarios in smart cities.},

As memory is restored to JVM automatically, Java developers are not responsible for explicitly deleting unused memory items. We study the performance of various GCs on an Apache Kafka-Storm platform for processing a real-time workload. We demonstrate that the choice of the Garbage collector is sensitive to the configuration of Kafka and the impact of Garbage Collection events on the latency of processing application.},

A major challenge, however, is determining the amount of resources required by big data stream processing applications in response to heterogeneous data sources, streaming events, unpredictable data volume and velocity changes. Over-provisioning of resources for peak loads can be wasteful while under-provisioning can have a huge impact on the performance of the streaming applications. The majority of research efforts on resource scaling in the cloud are investigated from the cloud provider's perspective, they focus on web applications and do not consider multiple resource bottlenecks. We aim at analyzing the resource scaling problem from a big data streaming application provider's point of view such that efficient scaling decisions can be made for future resource utilization. This paper proposes a Layered Multi-dimensional Hidden Markov Model (LMD-HMM) for facilitating the management of resource auto-scaling for big data streaming applications in the cloud. Our detailed experimental evaluation shows that LMD-HMM performs best with an accuracy of 98%, outperforming the single-layer hidden markov model.},

An example of a public repository is National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI’s) Reference Sequence (RefSeq). These repositories must decide in what form to make their data available. Unstructured data can be put to almost any use but are limited in how access to them can be scaled. Highly structured data offer improved performance for specific algorithms but limit the wider usefulness of the data. We present an alternative: lightly structured data stored in Apache Kafka in a way that is amenable to parallel access and streamed processing, including subsequent transformations into more highly structured representations. We contend that this approach could provide a flexible and powerful nexus of bioinformatic data, bridging the gap between low structure on one hand, and high performance and scale on the other. To demonstrate this, we present a proof-of-concept version of NCBI’s RefSeq database using this technology. We measure the performance and scalability characteristics of this alternative with respect to flat files.The proof of concept scales almost linearly as more compute nodes are added, outperforming the standard approach using files.Apache Kafka merits consideration as a fast and more scalable but general-purpose way to store and retrieve bioinformatic data, for public, centralized reference datasets such as RefSeq and for private clinical and experimental data.}},

  abstract     = {The work presented in this paper proposes a novel approach to tracking a specific vehicle over the video streams published by the collaborating traffic surveillance cameras. In recent years, smart, effective transportation systems and intelligent traffic management applications are among the topics that have been given importance by various institutions. Developing a scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilient traffic monitoring system that retrieves video chunks with the desired query is challenging. For these challenging problems, stream processing and data retrieval systems have been developed over the years. However, there are still existing shortcomings between users and retrieval systems. This paper investigates the problem of retrieving video chunks by key-value query based on publish/subscribe model. Thus, we propose a hybrid of an asynchronous and synchronous communication mechanism for the Event-Based Microservice framework. We aim to develop generic techniques for better utilization of existing platforms. In the proposed framework, (i) first of all, microservices detect vehicles and extract their type, color, and speed features, and stored them in the metadata repository. (ii) Microservices publish each feature as events (iii) Other microservices self-join subscribe to those events, which leads to more events being published by combing all the possibilities: type-color, type-speed, color-speed, and type-color-speed. Finally, (iv) the system visualizes the query result and system status in real-time. When the user has selected color or/and a type or/and a speed feature, the system will return the best-matched vehicles without re-processing the videos. Experimental results show that our proposed system filters messages in real-time and supports easy integration of new microservices with the existing system.},

In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time. The performance of the system is evaluated qualitatively using a web-interface where traffic administrators can provide the feedback about the quality of predictions and quantitatively using F-measure with an accuracy of over 80%.},

Compared with the traditional message queuing middleware, a streaming platform enables the implementation of event-streaming systems (ESS) which include not only complex queues but also pipelines that transform and react to the streams of data. By analysing the centralised data streams, one can evaluate the Quality-of-Service for other systems and components that produce or consume those streams. We consider the exploitation of probabilistic model checking as a performance monitoring technique for ESS systems. Probabilistic model checking is a mature, powerful verification technique with successful application in performance analysis. However, an ESS system may contain quantitative parameters that are determined by event streams observed in a certain period of time. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework called QV4M (meaning “quantitative verification for monitoring”) for monitoring ESS systems, which is based on two recent methods of probabilistic model checking. QV4M assumes the parameters in a probabilistic system model as random variables and infers the statistical significance for the probabilistic model checking output. We also present an empirical evaluation of computational time and data cost for QV4M.},
